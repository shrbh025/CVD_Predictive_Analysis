# Cardio Vascular Disease Predictive Analysis:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on various features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators. 

Background  
  ● The dataset contains records of patient data concerning 12 features:  
    ○ Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose,  
    Smoking, Alcohol Intake, Physical Activity, and the Presence or Absence of Cardiovascular Disease.  
    ○ Dataset values were collected at the moment of medical examination.  
    ○ Target class “cardio:”  
    ■ 1 = presence of Cardiovascular Disease  
    ■ 0 = absence of Cardiovascular Disease  
    ○ 70,000 rows of cardio dataset  
  ● Link to Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sulianova/eda-cardiovascular- data/notebook

Predictive Analysis & Conclusion    
  ● Models implemented:  
    ○ Decision Tree 
    ○ Random Forest Classifier 
    ○ Logistic Regression 
    ○ KNN
